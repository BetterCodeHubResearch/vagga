======
Errors
======

The document describes errors when running vagga on various systems. The manual
only includes errors which need more detailed explanation and troubleshooting.
Most errors should be self-descriptive.

.. _subuid:

Could not read /etc/subuid or /etc/subgid
-----------------------------------------

The full error might look like::

    ERROR:vagga::container::uidmap: Error reading uidmap: Can't open /etc/subuid: No such file or directory (os error 2)
    WARN:vagga::container::uidmap: Could not read /etc/subuid or /etc/subgid (see http://bit.ly/err_subuid)
    error setting uid/gid mappings: Operation not permitted (os error 1)

Or it might look like::


    WARN:vagga::container::uidmap: Could not find the user "your_user_name" in /etc/subuid or /etc/subgid (see http://bit.ly/err_subuid)
    Command <Command "/proc/self/exe" ("vagga_wrapper") "_build" "rust-musl"; environ: {"RUST_LOG"="warn","TERM"="screen","_VAGGA_HOME"="/var/empty",}; uid_map=[UidMap { inside_uid: 65534, outside_uid: 0, count: 1 }]; gid_map=[GidMap { inside_gid: 65534, outside_gid: 0, count: 1 }]>: error setting uid/gid mappings: Operation not permitted (os error 1)

The first message above means there is no ``/etc/subuid`` file.
It probably means you need to create one. The second option means there is
a ``/etc/subuid`` file but your user is absent in the file.

The recommended contents of ``/etc/subuid`` are following::

    your_user_name:100000:65536

You should **also** check ``/etc/subgid``, add presumably the same contents to
``/etc/subgid`` (In subgid file the first field still contains your user name
not a group name).

----

You may get another similar error::

    ERROR:vagga::container::uidmap: Error reading uidmap: /etc/subuid:2: Bad syntax: "user:100000:100O"
    WARN:vagga::container::uidmap: Could not read /etc/subuid or /etc/subgid (see http://bit.ly/err_subuid)
    error setting uid/gid mappings: Operation not permitted (os error 1)

This means somebody has edited ``/etc/subuid`` and made an error. Just open
the file (note it's owned by root) and fix the issue (in the example the last
character should be zero, but it's a letter "O").

.. _uidmap:

Can't find newuidmap or newgidmap
---------------------------------

Full error usually looks like::

    WARN:vagga::process_util: Can't find `newuidmap` or `newgidmap` (see http://bit.ly/err_idmap)
    error setting uid/gid mappings: No such file or directory (os error 2)

There might be two reasons for this:

1. The binaries are not installed (see below)
2. The commands are not in ``PATH``

In the latter case you should fix your ``PATH``.

The packages for Ubuntu >= 14.04::

    $ sudo apt-get install uidmap

The Ubuntu 12.04 does not have the package. But you may use the package from
newer release (the following version works fine on 12.04)::

    $ wget http://gr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/shadow/uidmap_4.1.5.1-1ubuntu9_amd64.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i uidmap_4.1.5.1-1ubuntu9_amd64.deb

Most distributions (known: Nix, Arch Linux, Fedora) have binaries as
part of "shadow" package, so have them installed on every system.

.. _root:

You should not run vagga as root
--------------------------------

Well, sometimes users get some ``permission denied`` errors and try to run vagga
with sudo. Running as root is **never** an answer.

Here is a quick check list on permission checks:

* Check owner (and permission bits) of ``.vagga`` subdirectory if it exists,
  otherwise the directory where ``vagga.yaml`` is (project dir). In case you
  have already run vagga as root just do ``sudo rm -rf .vagga``
* :ref:`subuid`
* :ref:`uidmap`
* Check ``uname -r`` to have version of ``3.9`` or greater
* Check ``sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone`` the setting must either
  *not exist* at all or have value of ``1``
* Check ``zgrep CONFIG_USER_NS /proc/config.gz`` or
  ``grep CONFIG_USER_NS "/boot/config-`uname -r`"`` (ubuntu)
  the setting should equal to ``y``

The error message might look like::

    You should not run vagga as root (see http://bit.ly/err_root)

Or it might look like a warning::

    WARN:vagga::launcher: You are running vagga as a user different from the owner of project directory. You may not have needed permissions (see http://bit.ly/err_root)

Both show that you don't run vagga with the user that owns the project.
The legitimate reasons to run vagga as root are:

* If you run vagga in container (i.e. in vagga itself) and the root is not a
  real root
* If your project dir is owned by root (for whatever crazy reason)

Both cases should inhibit the warning automatically, but as a last resort
you may try ``vagga --ignore-owner-check``. If you have good case where this
works, please file an issue and we might make the check better.

.. _virtualbox:

Don't run vagga on shared folders
---------------------------------

If you are testing or using vagga using an OS X machine, you might be tempted
to set up a Linux virtual machine and share your definitions into the machine. Sadly, this leads to the shared folder implementation lying to you: it pretends all files are owned by the user you use on the guest system, but this is not fully true. This manifests in errors such as this:

    vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant/vagga$ vagga doc
    (1/1) Installing alpine-keys (1.1-r0)
    OK: 0 MiB in 1 packages
    fetch http://dl-2.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.2/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
    (1/15) Installing musl (1.1.11-r2)
    (2/15) Installing busybox (1.23.2-r0)
    ERROR: Failed to set ownership on bin/bbsuid.apk-new: Operation not permitted
    ERROR: Failed to set file permissions on bin/bbsuid.apk-new: Operation not permitted
    ERROR: Failed to preserve modification time on bin/bbsuid.apk-new: Operation not permitted
    Executing busybox-1.23.2-r0.post-install

and subsequent errors, including vagga not being allowed to clean up after itself.

Don't use shared folders as your cache dir or storage dir, see :ref:`settings` for ways to change them.


.. _err-shared-memory:

Out of Shared Memory
--------------------

We use 100MiB for shared memory by default, to increase it add the
following to the volumes of your container (or command):

.. code-block:: yaml

    containers:
     some-container:
       volumes:
        /run: !Tmpfs
          size: 1Gi  # your new size of shared memory
          subdirs:
            shm:     # create shm directory


Known scenarios
```````````````

Facebook's flow_ requires a lot of shared memory. The error that can be
seen in the log is as follows::

    [2016-08-11 06:59:40] We've run out of filesystems to use for shared memory
    SharedMem.Out_of_shared_memory

The amount of memory needed probably depends on an application that is
being compiled by flow.
